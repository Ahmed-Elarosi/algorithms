# Standard Deviation Calculator in JavaScript

This is a simple JavaScript program to calculate the standard deviation of a set of numbers provided by the user. The program prompts the user to input the number of values (`n`), followed by the values themselves. It then computes and prints the standard deviation.

## How It Works

### Input:
- The program prompts the user for the number of values (`n`).
- The program then prompts the user to input each value one by one.

### Calculations:
1. The average (mean) of the values is calculated.
2. The variance is calculated by summing the squared differences between each value and the average.
3. The variance is divided by `n` to get the mean of these squared differences.
4. The standard deviation is computed as the square root of the variance.

### Output:
- The program logs the computed standard deviation to the console.

## Code Overview

### Variables:
- **`sd`**: Stores the calculated standard deviation.
- **`ave`**: Accumulates the sum of the input values and later stores the average.
- **`n`**: Number of input values.
- **`a`**: Accumulates the squared differences for variance calculation.
- **`b`**: Stores the calculated variance.
- **`x[]`**: An array to store the input values.

### Steps:
1. Get the number of inputs from the user.
2. Gather all the values and compute the average.
3. Calculate the variance.
4. Compute the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.
5. Print the result to the console.
